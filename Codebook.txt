There are 2 tidy datasets. the first dataset (combined_df2) encapsulates steps 1 to 4 of the assignment.
The second dataset (summary_table) encapsulates step 5 of the assignment and contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

(1) Dataset 1 - combined_df2
Identifier
    Each number corresponds to an individual who performed the activity

Activity
    Corresponds to the different activites an individual can undertake

Rest of the columns: Features variables, copied from 'Features' in UCI HAR Dataset
    
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
    '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
tBodyAcc-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
