The first part of the script completes steps 1, 3, and 4 of the assignment by combining the activity labels, participant labels, and feature data for both test and train subjects.

The second part of the script completes step 2 by extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

The third and last part of the script completes step 5 by grouping the data in the previous part by individual and activity, and finding the average of each feature.
